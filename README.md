Overview: This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sales Performance Analysis using Superstore Sales Data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify sales trends, and develop a predictive model for forecasting sales based on key factors such as profit and discount. The findings will help businesses optimize their strategies for pricing, marketing, and stock management.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The first phase of the project involves cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and detecting outliers. Statistical analysis is conducted to calculate descriptive metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for sales, profit, and discount. Correlation analysis is performed using heatmaps to identify relationships between key variables. Data visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and time-series plots, provide deeper insights into sales distribution, profit margins, and seasonal trends. One key finding is that higher discounts negatively impact profit, highlighting the importance of an optimized pricing strategy.

Sales Performance Analysis: In the second phase, a detailed analysis of sales trends over time is conducted to understand seasonal fluctuations. A scatter plot between profit and discount reveals that higher discounts generally lead to lower profits. Additionally, bar charts are used to analyze sales performance across different regions and product categories, identifying top-performing areas that contribute significantly to overall revenue. These insights help businesses refine their marketing and sales strategies.

Predictive Modeling: To forecast sales, a Linear Regression model is developed using profit and discount as input features. The model is evaluated using key performance metrics, including the R² score, which indicates the model’s ability to explain sales variance, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures prediction accuracy. The results show that while the model captures some trends, additional features may be needed to improve prediction performance.

Business Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, several strategic recommendations are provided. Businesses should reduce excessive discounts to prevent profit erosion while maintaining competitive pricing. Marketing efforts should focus on high-performing regions and product categories to maximize revenue. Additionally, stock planning should be aligned with seasonal demand trends to optimize inventory management and meet peak-period sales requirements.

Deliverables: The final outputs of the project include a cleaned dataset, a statistical and correlation analysis report, various data visualizations, a sales prediction model, and business strategy recommendations based on insights derived from the analysis.

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of sales trends and business performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing profitability and growth.
